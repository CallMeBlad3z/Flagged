# Flagged

A simple travel log mobile app to track your country visits with a minimalistic UI.

### Important
The app is not production ready as of now, so the backend connection isn't available to the public yet. I'll be removing this once it's up and running.

## Requirements

- Node.js (v18 or later)
- npm (v9 or later) or Yarn
- Android 14 (SDK 34)

## Installation
1. Clone or download the repository
2. In the root directory (package.json)
```
npm install
```
3. Make a prebuild of the project
```
npx expo prebuild
```
4. Build the project
```
npx expo run:android
```
## Running the project
```
npx expo run:android
```
